- **Lab Results**: 60+ biomarkers with clinical interpretation  
- **Risk Calculations**: Evidence-based algorithm results
- **Biological Age**: 4 different calculation methods
- **Recommendations**: Personalized interventions

### **Medical Standards**
- **Reference Ranges**: AHA/ACC, ADA, WHO, clinical laboratory standards
- **Risk Algorithms**: ASCVD, Framingham, FINDRISC, Phenotypic Age, Klemera-Doubal
- **Clinical Guidelines**: Evidence-based calculations with published sources

## üöÄ User Guide

### **For Development**
```bash
# Start development server
npm run build
pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs

# Database operations
npm run db:migrate:local    # Apply migrations
npm run db:seed            # Seed reference data
npm run db:console:local   # Database console

# Testing
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"password": "#*LonGenix42", "country": "US"}'
```

### **For End Users**
1. **Access System**: Enter password `#*LonGenix42` and select country
2. **Choose Assessment Method**: Manual entry, demo data, or file upload (coming soon)
3. **Complete Health Assessment**: 8-step comprehensive form (in development)
4. **Receive Personalized Report**: Evidence-based analysis with your name and data

## üè• Assessment Categories (10 Total)

### **Implemented in Database Schema**
1. **Disease Risk Calculations** (cardiovascular, diabetes, kidney, cancer)
2. **Biological Age Assessment** (4 methods: Phenotypic, Klemera-Doubal, Metabolic, Telomere)
3. **Functional Medicine Body Systems** (7 systems with clinical scoring)
4. **Biomarker Analysis** (60+ lab values with clinical interpretation)
5. **Hallmarks of Aging** (12 categories: 4 Primary + 4 Antagonistic + 4 Integrative)
6. **Hallmarks of Health** (8 categories with evidence-based scoring)
7. **Mind-Body-Spirit Assessment** (based on actual form responses)
8. **ATM Framework Analysis** (Antecedents, Triggers, Mediators)
9. **Lifestyle Risk Scoring** (exercise, nutrition, sleep, stress)
10. **Personalized Recommendations** (evidence-based interventions)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
